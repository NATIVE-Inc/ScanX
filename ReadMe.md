> Analyse 1000+ Scripts in a Minute

## Problem Statement 
The educational system is design in a way in which students write exams, the scripts are corrected by competent instructors and the results are documented and stored in manual/digital databases. Report cards are generated using word processing softwares.These informations are generally never analysed and the process is slow and error prone, the statistics from the results of students are not taken into consideration which makes the eductational system flawed.
+ Error prone
+ Slow 
+ No data Analysis
+ Local storage 
+ Not Future proof
+ No statistics

## Proposed Solution 
ScanX is an android application linked to a web application designed to work together for the analysis of data.
#### Data Collection ( ScanX - Android  App)
An android app is designed to collect the information from the script of the student notably: 
- Student Name
- Matricule 
- Course 
- Results
#### Data Manipulation ( WebX - Web Application )
The information scanned is sent to a web application, which then stores it into a database. The information in the database is then analysed to generate report cards and the following statistics:
- Charts
- Statistics 
- Analysis
For each student as well as class reports. These informations can be included into the student's report card to provide detailed information about the students progress.

#### Features 
 - Realtime 
 - Data Analysis
 - Statistics generation
 - Report generation
 - Verification and Validation
